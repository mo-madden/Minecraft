Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our server runs on the Minecraft Fabric 1.19.4 mod loader.

The only necessary installer is the Fabric installer if you do not already have it.
Find the fabric installer in the "Installers" directory.
Otherwise go to the official site: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
Double click the .jar file, and make sure to select 1.19.4 in the installation wizard.

The mods required to join the server are listed in the "Required Mods" directory.
Download each file, and copy them into your Minecraft mods folder.

Your Minecraft mods folder can be found at these locations:

If on Windows: %appdata%\\.minecraft\mods

If on Linux: $HOME\\.minecraft\mods

If on Mac: Lmao

If you have accomplished the above, you can now join the server.

Aditional Information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have placed additional mods in the "Michae's Recommended Mods" These mods are not
required to join the server, but either serve a functional purpose or aesthetic purpose.
One mod not listed (because the file was too large) is the Ambient Sounds 5 mod. The mod
and it's dependancy can be found at the links below.

Ambient Sounds 5: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ambientsounds/files?version=1.19.4&gameVersionTypeId=4
