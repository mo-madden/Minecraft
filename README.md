Minecraft mod lists

Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our server runs on the Minecraft Fabric 1.19.4 mod loader.

The only necessary installer is the Fabric installer if you do not already have it.
Find the fabric installer in the installer folder.
Otherwise go to the official site: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
Double click the .jar file, and make sure to select 1.19.4 in the installation wizard.

The mods required to join the server are listed in the "Required Mods" directory

Aditional Information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coming soon... I'm too tired to type this out right now.
